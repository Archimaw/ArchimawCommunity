#### Rules
- All forms of bigotry, harassment, doxing, exclusionary, or abusive behavior, excessive rudeness, impatience, and hostility aren't welcome. Don't rage out or make personal attacks against other people. Don't encourage users to brigade or raid other communities!

- Please refrain from advertising and self-promoting!
#### Partnership Program
Servers or streamers, who've gotten over 200+ members, can apply for partnership!
This gives permissions to invite our custom bots to their servers to manage with
limited features and other various things; but, paid features will remain paid.
#### Reputation
This is from your trading experiences and comments on your profile, someone can literally direct message the bot or use our server! If you scam or do something negative eventually the bot or professors will catch up on this and (Unfortunate things will happen)
#### Boosting & Rewards
There are various levels with the profiler, I haven't gone into detail about such as (badges, levels, forum levels, user reputation, bans, etc.) This information is just a basis for the server and keeps everyone informative about one another; there are some privacy settings with our bot, you can take advantage of and advancements of.
#### How to contribute?
I'm glad, you asked yourself this question, you can invite members and receive various rewards based (on the reward bot and boosting) helping us out, we'll give you more features and perks! (it's called fair trade literally! 😜)
#### Blacklisted Users
If you're blacklisted or sanctioned by another server within our environment or ecosystem; you're not allowed to come back nor get pardoned! This means you've done something unpleasant and undesirable to a bunch of communities or caused mayhem or illegal content!
#### Where to appeal?
You can open a ticket with the bot, when you joined the server; you're still able to apply even as a blacklisted member; but can't see anyone else- besides, who's in the ticket and will be given a server to appeal on.
